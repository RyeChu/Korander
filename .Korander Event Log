- just finished debugging the save and load functionality. should be working as long as you edit the actual object and not the variables.
- added files to GitHub

TO DO:
finish the player, npc and monster classes. There's going to be a lot of things being rewritten but i can merge them into a single parent class later. 
(probably a character class)
